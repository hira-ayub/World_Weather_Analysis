# World Weather Analysis

Once I created the planmytrip app, Jack recommended a few changes to take the app to the new level. We added the weather description so the user can filter the data for their weather preference. This app also creates a travel route between the cities choose by the user to create a marker layer map. This can help the user to plan the trip better and see what they need and how long it will take them to get to the destination and make plans about what form of transportation to use.
